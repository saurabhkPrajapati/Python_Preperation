Adapter Pattern:
    The Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together by creating
    a "wrapper" (adapter) that translates one interface to another.
    This is especially useful when you have existing code or libraries that need to be integrated but do not match the interface expected by your system

Scenario:
    Using a European Socket with an American Plug
    Suppose you're in Europe with an American plug device, and European sockets don't directly support it.
    The Adapter Pattern solves this by creating a "socket adapter" that converts the European socket to work with the American plug.

Implementation in Python
    Target Interface: EuropeanSocket represents the European standard socket.
    Adaptee: AmericanPlugDevice represents the incompatible American plug.
    Adapter: SocketAdapter makes AmericanPlugDevice compatible with EuropeanSocket.
