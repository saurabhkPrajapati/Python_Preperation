Decorator Pattern:
    The Decorator Design Pattern is a structural pattern used to dynamically add behavior or responsibilities to an object at runtime without modifying its structure.
    This is achieved by wrapping the object with one or more decorators, each providing additional functionality.
    Open/Closed Principle: the class is open for extension but closed for modification.

Key Concepts
    Component Interface: Defines the common interface for objects and their decorators.
    Concrete Component: The main object to which functionalities are added dynamically.
    Decorator: A class that implements the component interface and wraps the concrete component, adding extra behavior.
