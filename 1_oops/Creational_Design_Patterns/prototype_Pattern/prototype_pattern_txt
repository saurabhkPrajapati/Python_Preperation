Prototype:
    The Prototype Design Pattern is a creational pattern that allows you to create new objects by copying (or "cloning") an existing object,
    called the prototype, instead of instantiating a class directly.
    This is particularly useful when creating an object is costly, complex or inefficient, and you want to replicate it with minimal changes.

    Prototype Object: The base object with default attributes and state.
    Cloning: Creating a new object by duplicating the prototype, often using a clone or copy method.
    Customization: The cloned object can be customized after cloning to meet specific needs without affecting the prototype.

Avoiding Subclass Explosion:

Problem: When you have multiple configurations or variations of an object, using subclasses for each configuration can lead to a large number of classes that are hard to manage.
Solution: The Prototype Pattern allows for creating copies with specific configurations at runtime, so you don’t need to create a subclass for each possible variation.
Example: A graphics editor might use the Prototype Pattern to clone different shapes (Circle, Rectangle) and then modify their properties as needed.
         This avoids creating a subclass for each color, size, or pattern of each shape

Dynamic Object Creation at Runtime:

Problem: In some cases, you may need to create objects at runtime based on specific user input or environmental conditions that are unknown at compile time.
Solution: The Prototype Pattern allows for dynamically cloning and customizing objects at runtime, offering flexibility for complex object creation on-the-fly.
Example: In a video game, you might have various types of enemies or items that are generated dynamically based on game level or player actions.
         By cloning a prototype, the game can easily create variations of an enemy without knowing specifics beforehand

High Object Creation Costs:

Problem: Some objects are resource-intensive to create. They might require complex configurations, significant memory, or time to initialize.
Solution: The Prototype Pattern allows you to clone an existing object rather than creating a new instance from scratch, reducing the setup time and associated costs.
Example: Imagine a Document object that loads data from a database or has a lengthy setup.
         By cloning an existing Document prototype, you avoid repeatedly loading and configuring it.

Preserving Object State and Customization:

Problem: Sometimes, you need to create new instances with the same state as an existing object but want to tweak or customize the new instance.
Solution: With the Prototype Pattern, you can clone an object with the desired initial state, then make modifications to the clone without affecting the original.
Example: Consider a graphic design software where users frequently duplicate elements (e.g., a customized shape or text box) and then alter the copies.
         Cloning allows the user to duplicate and modify elements without changing the original, preserving the initial design

Simplifying Code for Complex Object Structures:

Problem: Some objects have complex, nested structures that are difficult to construct from scratch repeatedly.
Solution: The Prototype Pattern simplifies this by copying an existing prototype with a fully constructed state, saving effort and ensuring consistency in structure.
Example: In a content management system, duplicating a template for a website page (with predefined sections and layouts)
         is much easier through cloning than reassembling the structure each time from scratch.
