Builder pattern
    Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step.
    It separates the construction of an object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

In the Builder Pattern, "different representations" means that the same sequence of steps in the construction process
can produce objects with different structures, styles, or configurations

Components of the Builder Pattern
Product: The complex object that is being built.
Builder: An interface for creating parts of a Product object.
ConcreteBuilder: A class that implements the Builder interface and constructs the parts of the product.
                 Use this when multiple product options are there.
Director: A class that constructs an object using the Builder interface.
