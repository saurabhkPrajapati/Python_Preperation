Factory Design Pattern:

    The Factory Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that defines an interface for creating objects, 
    and allows subclasses or factory methods to decide which class to instantiate.

    This pattern is often implemented using a factory method or a factory class to produce instances of objects based on input criteria or conditions.
    The factory method offers us the best way to create an object. In this method, objects are created without revealing the logic to the client.
    To create a new type of object, the client uses the same common interface.
    Factory patterns allow the creation of objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created, promoting loose coupling and scalability in code.

    Simple Factory
    It's a commonly used pattern in real-world code.
    It's simpler than the Factory Method pattern.
    But — it does not follow Open/Closed Principle as cleanly (you must modify the factory method every time you add a new type).
