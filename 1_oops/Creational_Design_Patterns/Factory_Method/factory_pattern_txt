Factory Design Pattern:
    The Factory Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass,
    allowing subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created

    This pattern is often implemented using a factory method or a factory class to produce instances of objects based on input criteria or conditions.
    The factory method offers us the best way to create an object. In this method, objects are created without revealing the logic to the client.
    To create a new type of object, the client uses the same common interface.
    Factory patterns allow the creation of objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created, promoting loose coupling and scalability in code.
