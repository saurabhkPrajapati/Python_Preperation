1) What are the advantages of DBMS over traditional file-based systems? 

 1. Data redundancy 
 2. Inconsistency 
 3. Concurrent access by multiple users 
 4. Security problems
 5. Data isolation – multiple files and formats 
 

>> There can be multiple unique constrainst in one table

ACID >>

 Atomicity: The entire transaction takes place at once or doesn’t happen at all. There is no midway i.e. transactions do not occur partially.

 Consistency: "Correctness of a database". This encures that database must satisfy integrity constraint before and after transaction.
	      a = 10
	      b = 5
	      a to b = 2
	      10 + 5 = 8 +7 

 Isolation: This property ensures that multiple transactions can occur concurrently without interfering with each other.

 Durability: This property ensures that once the transaction has completed execution, the updates and modifications to the database will persist even if a system failure occurs.

Database normalization: reduce data redundancy and inconsistency

1NF: In table each  cell contains only one value

2NF:  All non-key attributes are fully dependent on a single primary key , not on part of primary key.( there  will be 2 or more primary key)

3NF: A relation will be in 3NF if it is in 2NF and not contain any transitive dependency.(Non-prime attributes should not depend on other non-prime attributes in a table)

Rollno	Game	Feestructure
1	Basketball	500
2	Basketball	500
3	Basketball	500
4	Cricket  	600
5	Cricket	        600
6	Cricket	        600
7	Tennis	        400

game-> feestructure. (feestruture depends on game)
game-> rollno -> feestructure




Anamolies >>
	Insertion anomaly − A new game can't be inserted into the table unless we get a student to play that game.

	Deletion anomaly − If rollno 7 is deleted from the table we also lost the complete information regarding tennis.

	Updation anomaly −To change the fee structure for basketball we need to make changes in more than one place.
