Iterators and generators are both used in Python for lazy evaluation and handling large datasets.

Iterator:
    An iterator is an object that implements using two methods: __iter__() and __next__().
    It allows iteration over a collection or a sequence of values, returning one value at a time.

Generator:
    A generator is a special type of iterator that is implemented using a function and the yield keyword.
    It automatically creates an iterator object, which yields values one at a time.


Generators are generally more efficient than iterators because they do not require
creating a class with __iter__() and __next__(). It automatically implement the iterator protocol


Iterator and generator both are not reusable
Once an iterator is exhausted (once __next__() raises StopIteration), it cannot be reused.
You need to create a new instance to iterate over the items again.
