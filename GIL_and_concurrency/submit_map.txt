Returns: A Future object for each task.

Execution order: Tasks are submitted to the pool and may complete in any order.

Result order: You have to explicitly call future.result() for each Future. 
              The results come in the order you call .result(), not necessarily in the order tasks completed. 
              Use reversed(futures) for getting results in reverse input order 

Flexibility: You can cancel, check status, or handle exceptions for each task individually.

Both ThreadPoolExecutor and ProcessPoolExecutor return Future objects when you submit tasks.

You can check completion with future.done(), wait with future.result(), or cancel with future.cancel().

Returns: An iterator of results.

Execution order: Tasks are still submitted concurrently and may finish in any order.

Result order: Always in the order of the input iterable, regardless of which task finishes first.

Simplicity: Cleaner syntax if you just want all results in order.
