The Global Interpreter Lock is a mutex (mutual exclusion lock) in CPython (the most common Python interpreter).
It ensures only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time inside a single process.

CPython’s memory management is not thread-safe by default.
The GIL simplifies memory access and garbage collection and avoids the need for locks throughout the interpreter.

Even if you have 100 threads in single process, only one can run Python code at any given moment — the others wait their turn

The GIL only blocks Python bytecode execution from running in multiple threads at the same time.
But when a thread is just waiting for I/O (like network, disk, or database), it’s not executing Python code, so CPython releases the GIL. This allows:
Another thread to acquire the GIL and execute Python code in the meantime.
Multiple I/O-bound threads to make progress in parallel — even though only one of them is actively running Python bytecode at a given moment.
