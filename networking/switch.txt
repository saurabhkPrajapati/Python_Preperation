NIC definition:
    A NIC (Network Interface Card) is the hardware component that connects a computer (or any device) to a network.
    Each NIC has a unique MAC(Media Access Control) address (like a hardware ID).
    
    It can be a physical card (plugged into the motherboard, like Ethernet card) or built-in (like Wi-Fi adapters in laptops).
    In cloud/virtual machines, NICs are software-defined (called vNICs).

Switch definition:
    Switch is device that connects multiple devices within a LAN
    It operates on layer 2 in OSI Model
    They forward traffic based on MAC addresses (not IP addresses)

_________________________Switch working in Layer 2: _________________________

1) Every NIC(network interface card) has a unique MAC address
    For example:
        PC1 → AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:01
        PC2 → AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:02
    These are “burned in” at manufacturing time (though they can sometimes be changed in software).

2) Frame creation (Layer 2)
    When PC1 wants to send data to PC2, it first needs PC2’s MAC address.
    If PC1 knows only PC2’s IP, it will use ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) to ask “Who has IP 192.168.1.2? Tell 192.168.1.1”.
    PC2 replies with its MAC address → AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:02.
    Now PC1 builds an Ethernet frame with:
        Destination MAC = PC2’s MAC
        Source MAC = PC1’s MAC

3) Switch behavior
    The switch receives the frame.
    It looks at the destination MAC.
    Using its MAC address table (CAM table), it forwards the frame only to the port where PC2 is connected.

4) Delivery
    PC2 receives the frame, sees its MAC matches the destination, and processes the data up the stack.

So switches forward traffic inside a LAN by reading MAC addresses (Layer 2).

________________________________________________________________________________________________
PC1 wants to talk to PC2
PC1 knows PC2’s IP (192.168.1.2), but doesn’t know the MAC address.

PC1 sends an ARP request as a broadcast frame: Who has 192.168.1.2? Tell 192.168.1.1
    This means every device in the LAN receives it.

All devices receive the ARP request, but only the device that owns IP 192.168.1.2 (PC2) responds.

PC2 replies directly (unicast) to PC1
